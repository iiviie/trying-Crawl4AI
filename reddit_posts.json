          "content_preview": "I\\'m an undergraduate college student majoring in urban planning. I did a ten-week planning internship with a local transit agency in my home area this past summer. It was my first internship related to my major. I enjoyed it and learned a lot. It felt like my dream internship in many ways because I want to pursue the transportation planning sector. Last month, a different transit agency managed by the agency that I interned with offered me and other interns who were in the intern program this summer a temporary employee position as a planner in their planning department. They\\'re expecting me to work for 960 hours during the fiscal year July 2025 to June 2026 and start no later than January 1, 2026. (The hour count is flexible and the roughly 400 hours I worked at the internship would be deducted.) They said that they\\'re flexible between me working in-person and remotely but they would like me to be in-person for at least some of the time. Unfortunately, the timing and location won\\'t work well for me logistically. I\\'ll still be at my college campus taking a full schedule of courses for my undergraduate degree between now and June 2026. These include required major courses that I must take in person. I won\\'t graduate until December 2026. My college is located hundreds of miles away from home. Even if I could work remotely, I don\\'t think I can handle working that many hours for them while taking the courses I have scheduled for the rest of this school year. (I thought about maybe taking a leave of absence for the rest of the year but that seems like a bad idea for reasons that make more sense for a separate post.) I feel terrible because a temporary planning position with this transit agency sounds like one of the most valuable opportunities ever for me. I would love to have an opportunity like this after I graduate from college but I don\\'t know if I\\'ll get one unless I intern with them again this summer. I silently declined the position. They sent the email about the opportunity. I responded by asking questions since I needed to clarify information with them. After receiving an email with all of their responses, I realized that this probably wasn\\'t going to work. I haven\\'t replied to them at all since then as I wasn\\'t sure if I should. However, I think it would be more polite for me to reply to them now. How should I politely decline the offer? How do I make it clear that I would be interested in an opportunity with them in the future? How do I avoid burning bridges with them? People I\\'ve asked for help recommended I don\\'t mention any details about the fact that I\\'m still at my college campus finishing my degree for the rest of this fiscal year. Do you agree?",

          "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m really confused about what direction to take next year, so I wanted to get some outside opinions. Here\u2019s my situation: After my B.Tech, I prepared for GATE 2025. I wrote the exam in February, and honestly, it didn\u2019t go well. From March to April, I was mostly at home because I wasn\u2019t sure what to do next. Around May\u2013June, a relative suggested building a CRM software product. So I moved to another town with a friend (he\u2019s a senior developer), and we both worked on it for about 6 months. By December, we actually launched the CRM, and some customers are already using it. We even registered a company around this product. Side by side, we also started another small setup called MarkOps, where we build marketing/operations automation, pipelines, workflows, etc. So in short, I have spent the last year building real products, but not working in any \u201cofficial industry job\u201d. Now the confusion: I don\u2019t think I can fully depend on the CRM business right now. It\u2019s growing, but not stable enough to rely on. At the same time, I really want to get an actual job because I don\u2019t have corporate experience and I feel like I need that stability. So I\u2019m stuck between these options: 1. \u2060Focus fully on getting a job in 2025 (React/Full-Stack/Automation roles). 2. \u2060Do a course with placement support to increase my chances. 3. \u2060If nothing works out by next year, go for a Masters in Australia (Sept intake). I genuinely don\u2019t know which path to pick. Should I focus only on job applications? Should I invest in a course? Or should I plan for a Masters abroad? If anyone has gone through something similar, or has advice on what would make the most sense long-term, please share your thoughts. I really need some clarity. Thanks in advance.",

But the boss (the mentioned person) sometimes acts very demanding, often nags others, and half of the Zoom calls could have been emails, and so on. But still, it provides me with lots of experience which I could probably use in the future, so as long as I don\\'t get scolded for no reason, everything is okay. What really weirds me out is the fact that interns get hired and fired left and right; during my first (and only for now) month, at least five people left (some of them worked for even less period of time than me) and were almost immediately replaced by some new interns, and the boss says weird things about them being \\\"not supportive of the company spirit\\\".

I am in a very tough spot right now. since Im an international student I also have to think about visa / Sponsorship. ServiceNow has a conversation rate of 85% and they sponsor 200-300 international students every year. Getting a return offer is very competitive at Google (Mandiant) but ofc it\u2019s google and will open so many door for me. What would you do if you were in my situation?",

I had also applied for a Data analyst role at the same company and have a call with a different recruiter about this role today. I am fully invested in the Security role as that aligns more with my goals and passions. Any advice on what to say to this other recruiter even though my mind is already set on the other position? Should I say it in the phone call we have later today or email her afterwards? Edit: I know nothing is guaranteed that\u2019s why i\u2019m going through with the interview I just meant should I say anything to the recruiter about interviewing for both roles, would that be unprofessional if I didn\u2019t I guess is more my question.",

The problem is updating my resume was easy, but updating my personal website to match it was a nightmare. My portfolio was always outdated compared to my CV. So I built a system where you enter your data once, and it auto-generates: A hosted Personal Website. A live Portfolio. An ATS-Proof Resume (PDF). The AI Part: You can paste a job description, and it rewrites your bio/skills across all three assets to match that specific job. It is free to sign up and build your site (24-hour full access pass, no credit card needed). I want you to actually use it and tell me if the AI writes like a human or a robot. I\u2019m looking for honest feedback on the UX. Does the sync feel fast enough? Link: [foliomatic.io/students] Thanks for helping a CS student out!",
